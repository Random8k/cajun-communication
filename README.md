# JustNews

Just news is a simple news app for Android devices built using the Ionic Framework and powered by an API sourced from NewsAPI.org. Built as an individual project for a class to show proof-of-concept mainly; it shows U.S. news from a variety of sources, supports custom searching, has several topic tabs to choose from, and (eventually!) will support content provider selection.

* [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro) - The mobile framework used
* [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/docs) - API Source

## Acknowledgments

* Ionic, for providing an easy to use framework.
* NewsAPI, for providing the backbone for the application
* My instructor, for giving me the knowledge (and code!) to get started
